During my Ph.D., I would like to pursue a bidirectional research agenda between AI and networking. On one hand, I will continue to work on AI-driven wireless and networking, leveraging deep reinforcement learning, graph-based models, and generative approaches to design next-generation radio resource management, congestion control, and network slicing algorithms that can be deployed in realistic wireless and networked systems. On the other hand, I am equally interested in wireless- and networking-driven AI, using real-world communication constraints—such as latency, bandwidth limitations, partial observability, and reliability requirements—as a testbed to develop new algorithms and theory for constrained and distributed learning.

With this perspective, I hope to publish in both leading networking conferences (e.g., INFOCOM, MobiCom, GLOBECOM, ICC), where I emphasize system performance and deployability, and top machine learning venues (e.g., ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS), where the focus is on the fundamental aspects of learning under network constraints and structured environments.
