I am seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in Fall 2027 at the intersection of machine learning and wireless networking systems, with a focus on next-generation wireless communications and intelligent resource management. During my Ph.D., I plan to pursue a **bidirectional research agenda** between AI and networking.

## AI-Driven Wireless and Networking

I will continue developing intelligent algorithms for next-generation wireless systems, particularly **6G AI-RAN** (AI-Native Radio Access Networks). My research addresses cross-layer resource optimization using constrained deep reinforcement learning to handle throughput-memory tradeoffs and dynamic user mobility, adaptive learning mechanisms that detect distribution shifts and trigger efficient fine-tuning, and hybrid frameworks combining model-free reinforcement learning with Lyapunov optimization for stability guarantees. These techniques extend to broader networking challenges including congestion control, network slicing, and distributed edge computing.

## Wireless- and Networking-Driven AI

I am equally interested in **using communication constraints to advance machine learning theory**. Wireless systems present unique challenges including limited bandwidth, time-varying channels, partial observability, and strict latency requirements that inspire new learning paradigms. My work explores out-of-distribution detection via generative models to identify scenario shifts and trigger adaptation, few-shot and meta-learning for rapid network reconfiguration with minimal data, and communication-efficient distributed learning through gradient compression and asynchronous federated learning over wireless networks.

## Perspective

With this bidirectional perspective, I aim to publish in both leading networking venues (INFOCOM, MobiCom, ICC, GLOBECOM) emphasizing system performance and deployability, and top machine learning conferences (ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS) focusing on fundamental learning theory under network constraints. Ultimately, I envision my research bridging theoretical ML advances and practical wireless systems, contributing algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and deployable in real-world networks.
