I am currently seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in Fall 2027 in areas at the intersection of machine learning and wireless/networked systems, with a particular focus on next-generation wireless communications and intelligent resource management.

During my Ph.D., I plan to pursue a **bidirectional research agenda** between AI and networking:

## AI-Driven Wireless and Networking

I will continue developing intelligent algorithms for next-generation wireless systems, particularly 6G AI-RAN (AI-Native Radio Access Networks). My research focuses on:

- **Cross-layer resource optimization** using constrained deep reinforcement learning, addressing real-world challenges such as throughput-memory tradeoffs, dynamic user mobility, and heterogeneous QoS requirements
- **Adaptive learning mechanisms** that trigger fine-tuning based on distribution shifts in wireless environments, reducing retraining overhead while maintaining performance
- **Hybrid optimization frameworks** that combine model-free RL with model-based techniques (e.g., Lyapunov optimization) to provide stability guarantees and constraint satisfaction in resource allocation

## Wireless- and Networking-Driven AI

Conversely, I am equally interested in using communication constraints as a catalyst for advancing machine learning theory and algorithms. Real-world wireless and networked systems present unique challenges—limited bandwidth, time-varying channels, partial observability, strict latency requirements, and distributed agents—that can inspire new learning paradigms:

- **Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and adaptation**: Developing generative models (e.g., VAEs, diffusion models) to identify scenario shifts in wireless environments and trigger adaptive learning, addressing the gap between offline training and online deployment
- **Few-shot and meta-learning**: Designing algorithms that quickly adapt to new network configurations or user behaviors with minimal data, critical for dynamic wireless systems
- **Communication-efficient distributed learning**: Exploring gradient compression, quantization, and asynchronous updates for federated learning over wireless networks

## Perspective

With this bidirectional perspective, I aim to publish in both leading networking venues (e.g., **INFOCOM, MobiCom, SIGCOMM**) emphasizing system performance and deployability, and top machine learning conferences (e.g., **ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS**) focusing on fundamental learning theory under network constraints.

Ultimately, I envision my research bridging the gap between theoretical ML advances and practical wireless systems, contributing algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and deployable in real-world networks.
