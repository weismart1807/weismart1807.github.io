I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Communication Engineering at National Central University, Taiwan. Currently, I am conducting undergraduate research under the supervision of [Prof. Chih-Wei Huang](https://sites.google.com/ce.ncu.edu.tw/cwhuang), focusing on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Networking and Resource Allocation. 

Fortunately, I spent the summer of 2025 at the Chinese University of Hong Kong as a Summer Research Student advised by [Prof. Bei Yu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/), working on graph learning for EDA. I also interned at the [Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/) (Hsinchu, summer 2024) and [Chunghwa Telecom](https://www.cht.com.tw/en/home/cht) (Taipei, Sep–Dec 2025), developing LLM-powered applications and automation workflows.
 
### My research interests focus on:  
* *Machine Learning for Next-generation Wireless Communication and Networking*
* *Foundations and Algorithms of Generative Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning*  
* *Graph-based Learning for Logic Synthesis and Timing Prediction in EDA*
