I am an undergraduate researcher in [Communication Engineering at National Central University](https://www.ce.ncu.edu.tw/en), Taiwan, where I will graduate in 2026. Currently, I work on AI for wireless resource management under [Prof. Chih-Wei Huang](https://sites.google.com/ce.ncu.edu.tw/cwhuang). 

During the summer of 2025, I was a summer research student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Bei Yu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/), working on graph learning for electronic design automation. In addition to my research, I also held AI software internships at [Chunghwa Telecom](https://www.cht.com.tw/en/home/cht) and [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/), focusing on system automation and AI application.

*Starting in March 2026*, I will join [Wireless Mobile Network Lab at National Taiwan University](https://wmnlab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/lab/about.html), Taiwan, as an undergraduate research assistant, focusing on 6G AI-RAN Orchestration with [Prof. Hung-Yu Wei](https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~hywei/).
 
### My research interests include:
* *AI-Native Wireless Networking and Next-Generation Radio Access Networks*
* *Learning-Based Cross-Layer Resource Allocation and Optimization*  
* *Deep Generative Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection and Adaptive Learning*
