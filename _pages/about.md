I’m Wei-Jhih Huang (黃威智), a final-year undergraduate student in Communication Engineering at National Central University (NCU), Taiwan.

My research interests include AI for Wireless Communications and Networking, AI for Electronic Design Automation (EDA), and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am particularly passionate about integrating graph learning, deep reinforcement learning, and generative AI into real-world applications.
