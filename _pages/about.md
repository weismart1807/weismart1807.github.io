I am a senior undergraduate in Communication Engineering at National Central University, Taiwan, researching DRL-based wireless resource management under **[Prof. Chih-Wei Huang](https://sites.google.com/ce.ncu.edu.tw/cwhuang)**. I will join National Taiwan University, Taiwan, in March 2026 as a Research Assistant, focusing on 6G AI-RAN under **[Prof. Hung-Yu Wei](https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~hywei/)**.

During the summer of 2025, I was a Summer Research Student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, advised by **[Prof. Bei Yu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/)**, working on graph learning for electronic design automation. I also interned at the [Chunghwa Telecom](https://www.cht.com.tw/en/home/cht) and [Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/) for AI application.
 
### My research interests focus on:  
* *AI-Native Wireless Networks and Next-Generation Radio Access Networks*
* *Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cross-Layer Resource Allocation and Optimization*  
* *Deep Generative Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection and Adaptive Learning*
