I am a senior undergraduate student in the [Department of Communication Engineering](https://www.ce.ncu.edu.tw/en) at National Central University, Taiwan. Currently, I am conducting undergraduate research under the supervision of [Prof. Chih-Wei Huang](https://sites.google.com/ce.ncu.edu.tw/cwhuang), focusing on **deep reinforcement learning for wireless networking and resource allocation**.  

I was a Summer Research Student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by [Prof. Bei Yu](https://cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/) (summer 2025), working on graph learning for electronic design automation (EDA).  
I also interned at the [Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/) (summer 2024) and [Chunghwa Telecom](https://www.cht.com.tw/en/home/) (fall 2025–present), applying AI and large language models to system-level automation.  
 

My research interests focus on:  
* *Machine Learning for wireless communication systems*
* *Deep Reinforcement Learning for wireless resource allocation*  
* *Graph learning for EDA in logic synthesis* 
* *AI for systems and design performance*
