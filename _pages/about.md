I am a senior undergraduate student in the [Department of Communication Engineering](https://www.ce.ncu.edu.tw/en) at National Central University, Taiwan. Currently, I am conducting undergraduate research under the supervision of [Prof. Chih-Wei Huang](https://sites.google.com/ce.ncu.edu.tw/cwhuang), focusing on **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Networking and Resource Allocation**. Looking ahead, I’m extending these learning-based RRM methods from wireless networks to on-chip interconnects, especially **Wireless Networks-on-Chip (WiNoC)**, targeting tail-latency-aware QoS under energy/thermal constraints. 

Fortunately, I spent the summer of 2025 at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as a Summer Research Student advised by [Prof. Bei Yu](https://cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/), working on graph learning for electronic design automation (EDA).  
I also interned at the [Industrial Technology Research Institute](https://www.itri.org.tw/english/) (summer 2024) and [Chunghwa Telecom](https://www.cht.com.tw/en/home/) (fall 2025–present), applying AI and large language models to system-level automation.  
 

My research interests focus on:  
* *Machine Learning for wireless communication and networking systems*
* *Deep reinforcement learning for resource management and allocation*  
* *Graph learning for EDA and architecture-aware design space exploration* 
* *ML-driven resource management for Wireless Networks-on-Chip*
